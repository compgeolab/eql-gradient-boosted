  abstract = {{The equivalent layer calculation becomes more efficient by first converting the observed potential data set to a much smaller equivalent data set, thus saving considerable CPU time. This makes the equivalent-source method of data interpolation very competitive with other traditional gridding techniques that ignore the fact that potential anomalies are harmonic functions. The equivalent data set is obtained by using a least-squares iterative algorithm at each iteration that solves an underdetermined system fitting all observations selected from previous iterations and the observation with the greatest residual in the preceding iteration. The residuals are obtained by computing a set of 'predicted observations' using the estimated parameters at the current iteration and subtracting them from the observations. The use of Cholesky's decomposition to implement the algorithm leads to an efficient solution update everytime a new datum is processed. In addition, when applied to interpolation problems using equivalent layers, the method is optimized by approximating dot products by the discrete form of an analytic integration that can be evaluated with much less computational effort. Finally, the technique is applied to gravity data in a 2 X 2 degrees area containing 3137 observations, from Equant-2 marine gravity survey offshore northern Brazil. Only 294 equivalent data are selected and used to interpolate the anomalies, creating a regular grid by using the equivalent-layer technique.For comparison, the interpolation using the minimum-curvature method was also obtained, producing equivalent results.The number of equivalent observations is usually one order of magnitude smaller than the total number of observations. As a result, the saving in computer time and memory is at least two orders of magnitude as compared to interpolation by equivalent layer using all observations.}},

  abstract = {Green functions of the biharmonic operator, in one and two dimensions, are used for minimum curvature interpolation of irregularly spaced data points. The interpolating curve (or surface) is a linear combination of Green functions centered at each data point. The amplitudes of the Green functions are found by solving a linear system of equations. In one (or two) dimensions this technique is equivalent to cubic spline (or bicubic spline) interpolation while in three dimension it corresponds to multiquadric interpolation. Although this new technique is relatively slow, it is more flexible than the spline method since both slopes and values can be used to find a surface. Moreover, noisy data can be fit in a least squares sense by reducing the number of model parameters. These properties are well suited for interpolating irregularly spaced satellite altimeter profiles. The long wavelength radial orbit error is suppressed by differentiating each profile. The shorter wavelength noise is reduced by the least squares fit to nearby profiles. Using this technique with 0.5 million GEOS-3 and SEASAT data points, it was found that the marine geoid of the Caribbean area is highly correlated with the sea floor topography. This suggests that similar applications, in more remote, areas may reveal new features of the sea floor.},

  abstract = {{Traditionally, reduction to the pole has been accomplished either by space- or wavenumber-domain filtering. In the two-dimensional case, this procedure is stable regardless of the latitude, as long as the source strike is not parallel to the horizontal projection of the geomagnetic field. In the three-dimensional case, however, reduction-to-the-pole filtering is stable only at high magnetic latitudes. At latitudes lower than 15 degrees, it is of no practical use due to a sharply increasing instability toward the magnetic equator.The three-dimensional instability of this filtering technique is demonstrated, and the reduction-to-the-pole problem is formulated in the context of a general linear inverse problem. As a result, stable solutions are found by using well-known stabilizing procedures developed for the inverse linear problem. The distribution of magnetization of an equivalent layer of doublets that reproduces the observed data is computed. The magnetic doublets are parallel to the magnetization direction which is assumed constant throughout the sources. The magnetic field reduced to the pole is then obtained by changing the inclinations of the geomagnetic field and the doublets to 90 degrees and recalculating the total field.The usefulness and limitations of the method at low magnetic latitudes are assessed using theoretical data. The effects of noise and anomaly truncation are also investigated for both high and low latitudes. In all cases, application of the proposed method produced meaningful results regardless of the latitude. The method is applied to field data from two different low-latitude anomalies. The first anomaly is due to a seamount in the Gulf of Guinea with reversed magnetization. The geomagnetic field at this location is about -23 degrees. The second anomaly is an intrabasement anomaly from Parnaiba Basin, Brazil, where the magnetization is assumed to be induced by a geomagnetic field with -1.4 degree inclination. The results obtained confirm that the proposed method produces stable, meaningful, reduced-to-the-pole maps.}},
