\section{Introduction}

Potential field data, like gravity and magnetics, are useful for geophysics exploration.
The potential field data can be obtained from ground, airborne or satellite
measurements.
On ground surveys the data is often gathered on scattered points or following irregular
paths.
On airborne surveys the data is gathered on flight paths, producing a large number of
data points concentrated along almost straight lines.
To improve visualization of the data for interpretation and to prepare the data for
processing through different methods (RTP, upward continuation, Euler deconvolution,
etc), the data needs to be interpolated on a regular grid of data points.

There are several methods for interpolating 2D data like minimum curvature, biharmonic
Splines or Kriging.
These all-purpose methods show a few problems when applied to potential field data.
(i) They don't take into account the height of the observation points. Potential field
data has a strong dependency on measurement height.
(ii) The predicted grid data is not necessary an Harmonic function.
(iii) They don't usually take into account the anisotropy of the observation points in
ground and airborne surveys.

One of the most widely used methods for interpolating gravity and magnetic data is the
equivalent sources technique (also known as equivalent layer, radial basis functions or
Green's functions interpolation).
It consists in estimating a source distribution that produces the same field as the one
measured and using this estimate to predict new values.
\citet{dampney1969} was the first to introduce the equivalent source technique.

The EQL can be used for interpolation of potential field data \citep{cordell1992,
cooper2000}.
It has been also used for applying a reduction to the pole to magnetic data
\citep{guspi2009, silva1986, emilia1973, nakatsuka2006} or an upward continuation
(cite).

The most widely used source distribution is a set of point sources.
The potential field of point sources is easy to compute.
How to locate these point masses?
Existing approaches:
(i) one point source beneath each observation point at a constant depth (cite),
(ii) one point source beneath each observation point at a depth proportional to the
distance to its nearest data points (cite),
(iii) a regular grid of point sources (missing citations).

We want to find out which distribution of sources produces the best interpolations.
